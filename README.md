## Description
HotBlock is a funny PvP minigame. The goal is to stand as long as possible on the 'hot block' in the middle of the arena in order to earn money (via EconomyAPI). Because every player wants to get there, there is an exiting PvP-match. The dangerous poisoned blocks are making the game even more exiting.

## Features
- Open game arena
- Exiting PvP-matches for the players
- Customizable messages and abuse-protection

## Usage
There are different types of blocks in the game arena:

| Block | PvP | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WOOD` | ❌ | All players are safe, usually they spawn there |
| `ENDSTONE` | ✅ | Normal playing field, nothing special here |
| `NETHERRACK` | ✅ | Players get poisoned for 2-3 seconds when walking over those blocks
| `QUARTBLOCK` | ✅ | The HotBlock, players are earning some coins per second when moving on this block |
